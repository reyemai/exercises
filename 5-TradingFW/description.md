- Use widely used operating systems, such as Windows/Linux/Mac

## Functional requirements

- Signals based on market data to provide a prediction of future price movement
- Strategy to execute orders based on the output of the signal based statistical model and market conditions
- Reasonable level of modular programming to make sure code is readable and maintainable
